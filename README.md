# Coding-Challenge

## First Assumption of Solution:
```
function rand11() {
  var random = Math.floor(Math.random() * 11) + 1;
  return random;
}
function rand13() {
  var priorRandom = rand11();
  var newRandom = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
  return priorRandom + newRandom;
}
rand13();
```
When first faced with the challenge my initial thought was to store the number generated by the *rand11* function into the *priorRandom* variable and add that to the *newRandom* variable to give me values from 1-13.  The *newRandom* variable would store the value of a randomly generated number between 0-2 using ```Math.floor(Math.random()*3)```. This was all done in the *rand13* function. However, after calculating the probabilities of each individual number I quickly learned that this was a very naive attempt and the function would not result in equal probabilities as there were various ways of creating specific numbers, i.e., there was only 1 way to create the number 1 using this function and 2 ways to create a number 2. The number 1 could only be achieved by generating a 1 from the *priorRandom* variable and adding it to a 0 generated from the *newRandom* variable. However, for the number 2, if both *priorRandom* and *newRandom* generated a 1, then the final number would result in a 2. Additionally, we could get the number 2 if *priorRandom* generated a 2 and was added to a 0 generated from the *newRandom*. Thus, the number of ways to create 1-13 using this initial method varied and is as follows:



Seeing this I realized I had to modify this function to try and create a method that would allow each number to have the same amount of ways of being created. It made sense to me that controlling the number of ways for each outcome would be easiest so the number of ways to create each number was 1. This then led to my next assumption of the solution.
